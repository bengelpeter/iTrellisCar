README

This is Peter Bengel's code project.

The code project I did was Car Dealership using these options below:

Domain: Car Dealership
Interface: Web API
Platform: .NET
Backend: C# 
Frontend: Angular

This program uses a .NET Core API for the backend with Angular 8.1.1 as the front end.

For unit testing I used a xUnit Test Project to create multiple unit test cases to use against my code. 

The site should be a able to be tested/viewed through IISExpress.
